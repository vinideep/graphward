description: Stress-test a plan, proposal, or PRD through Socratic questioning to identify edge cases, failure modes, and trade-offs before implementation.

# Grill Me

Use the `socratic-stress-tester` capability to conduct a rigorous pre-flight alignment interview on a technical plan or PRD.

## Pipeline

1. **Read Proposal & Context** — Inspect the target proposal, relevant architecture docs in `.graphward/knowledge-base/`, and dependency graphs in `.graphward/graph/`.
2. **Execute Socratic Gauntlet** — Challenge the proposal across boundary conditions, failure/rollback modes, blast radius, NFRs, and complexity.
3. **Pose Targeted Options** — Present 2–4 high-impact questions with concrete multiple-choice trade-offs.
4. **Finalize Aligned Plan** — Update the technical plan with resolved decisions and confirmed assumptions before implementation starts.

## Completion Report

Finish with:
- Summary of resolved trade-offs and decisions
- List of confirmed assumptions vs. verified facts
- Next suggested action (e.g. `/graphward` or `/tdd`)

**Contract**: This workflow does not modify product code.
