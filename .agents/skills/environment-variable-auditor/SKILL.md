# Environment Variable Auditor

Use this skill when code adds, removes, or changes environment variables, configuration schemas, deployment manifests, or CI/CD secrets.

**Run the deterministic gate first:** `npx gw gate env-vars .` (add `--json` for structured output). It reports variables referenced in code but missing from `.env.example`, and declared-but-unused variables, with file:line evidence. Use the steps below only to extend the audit to validation schemas, CI secrets, and deploy config the gate does not cover.

## Procedure

1. Detect environment variable reads:
   - Node: `process.env.*`
   - Python: `os.environ`, `os.getenv`
   - Go: `os.Getenv`
   - Ruby: `ENV[]`
   - Java/Kotlin/C#: equivalent environment APIs
2. Compare against `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, README setup docs, deployment manifests, CI secret declarations, and validation schemas such as Zod, envalid, pydantic, dotenv-safe, or custom config loaders.
3. Flag:
   - missing example entries
   - missing validation/default
   - stale example vars no longer used
   - required vars not present in CI/deployment docs
   - secrets accidentally committed or documented with real values
4. Block completion for newly required production env vars without docs and validation.

## Output

Write `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/environment-variable-audit.md`:

```markdown
# Environment Variable Audit: <unit>

| Variable | Usage | Example Present | Validation Present | Deployment/CI Present | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Required Fixes
- <missing or stale env handling>
```

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Env reads were scanned
- [ ] Example files and validation schemas were checked
- [ ] CI/deployment declarations were checked when present
- [ ] New required env vars are documented and validated

## Invocation Policy

- **Use when:** the selected entry workflow explicitly routes to environment-variable-auditor.
- **Do not use when:** direct selection from an unclassified user request.
- This is an internal engine. An entry workflow must select it; do not compete with entry workflows for the user request.
