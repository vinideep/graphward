# Graph Engine

Build and maintain structured, evidence-backed architecture graphs that enable impact analysis, dependency tracing, and architectural understanding.

**Build the real graph first:** `npx gw map . [--update --files a,b]` produces the computed, schema-validated `dependency-graph.json` from source imports. It resolves specifiers against disk and records anything it cannot resolve in `unknowns` rather than guessing. Use the steps below to derive the service, runtime, and business-flow graphs the CLI does not compute.

GraphWard's normalized graph is canonical. Graphify is an optional code-only extractor behind the provider adapter: fresh agreement with native GraphWard extraction is corroborated evidence; Graphify-only edges remain provider-extracted/unverifiable; conflicts are `contested`; stale or out-of-scope evidence is excluded. Every provider relationship must retain provider/version, commit, source hash/span, extraction class, confidence, freshness, and trust state. Never copy raw Graphify output over GraphWard's graph or treat CCE's internal graph as a second authority.

## Inputs

- Repository root path
- Mode: `full` (initialization/remapping) or `incremental` (post-change update)
- Optional: scope constraints for incremental updates

## Graph Artifacts

All graphs are stored in `.graphward/graph/`.

### Graph JSON Schema

Each JSON graph uses this envelope:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "graphType": "dependency | service | runtime | business-flow",
  "generatedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "scope": "<repository/package/scope examined>",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "<stable identifier>",
      "kind": "<graph-specific kind>",
      "label": "<human name>",
      "path": "<repository path when applicable>",
      "confidence": "verified | inferred | unknown",
      "metadata": {},
      "evidence": ["<file path or configuration evidence>"]
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "<node id>",
      "to": "<node id>",
      "relation": "<relationship>",
      "confidence": "verified | inferred | unknown",
      "metadata": {},
      "evidence": ["<file path or configuration evidence>"]
    }
  ],
  "unknowns": ["<unconfirmed relationship or flow>"]
}

- **Data Flow** — Data transformation pipelines (from data-flow-graph)

## Procedure

### Full Mode (initialization or remapping)

1. Scan all package manifests, imports, route definitions, service configs, and infrastructure files
2. Build all five graphs from scratch
3. Assign `verified` confidence to edges backed by explicit code evidence
4. Assign `inferred` confidence to edges derived from patterns or naming conventions
5. Integrate git change coupling data from `git-intelligence-engine` as `co-change` edges when coupling strength is above `0.7`, confidence is `inferred`, and evidence cites commit ranges or reports
6. Build `imports-type` edges from type checker/compiler API evidence when typed languages are detected
7. Build function-level call graph nodes for critical paths in `runtime-graph.json`
8. Annotate runtime edges with `metadata.hotness` derived from `critical-paths.md`, test coverage frequency, and git co-change strength
9. Classify sensitive data nodes in `data-flow-graph.json` with `metadata.sensitivity` (`pii`, `token`, `payment`, `credential`, `health`, `regulated`, `none`) and track propagation to sinks
10. Mark unresolvable relationships as `unknown` and add to `unknowns` array
11. Generate Mermaid diagrams in `architecture-map.md`

### Incremental Mode (post-change update)

1. Accept changed files/scope from the impact report or diff
2. Identify affected nodes and edges across all graphs
3. Update, add, or remove only affected nodes and edges
4. Preserve stable node IDs — only change an ID if the represented element was renamed
5. Update `imports-type`, `co-change`, function call, hotness, and sensitive data annotations where affected
6. Re-derive affected sections of `architecture-map.md`
7. Require full remapping only when structural impact cannot be bounded

## Rules

- Keep node IDs stable across incremental updates while the represented element still exists
- Never mark an edge `verified` without evidence paths
- Distinguish `inferred` and `unknown` relationships clearly
- Derive Mermaid diagrams in `architecture-map.md` from the JSON graph content — never hand-author diagrams that contradict the JSON
- For ordinary changes, update only impacted nodes, edges, maps, and connected context documents
- Rebuild all graphs on initialization, explicit mapping request, or when structural impact cannot be bounded
- Do not add `co-change` edges below `0.7` coupling strength
- Sensitive data propagation to unencrypted channels, logs, or unvalidated sinks must become a security finding in the impact report
- Apply `ProjectFilePolicy` consistently; imports into excluded generated output are external/generated references, not source modules
- Do not use `stale`, `contested`, `unverifiable`, or `missing` provider edges to derive verified claims

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All five JSON graphs (`dependency-graph.json`, `service-graph.json`, `runtime-graph.json`, `business-flow-graph.json`, `data-flow-graph.json`) validate against the schema above
- [ ] Every `verified` edge has at least one evidence path
- [ ] No `unknown` relationships are left out of the `unknowns` array
- [ ] `architecture-map.md` Mermaid diagrams are syntactically valid
- [ ] Node IDs are stable across incremental updates
- [ ] Type dependencies are represented as `imports-type` where applicable
- [ ] Co-change edges above `0.7` are represented or explicitly unavailable
- [ ] Runtime critical paths include function-level nodes where detectable
- [ ] Sensitive data nodes and propagation edges are annotated in `data-flow-graph.json`
- [ ] Hot path edges include `metadata.hotness` when evidence exists
- [ ] Graph contains no secret, provider-cache, vendored, generated-build, or benchmark-fixture source nodes
- [ ] Provider provenance and trust state survive normalization and reconciliation

## Cross-References

- Used by: `initialize-intelligence-skill`, `impact-analysis-engine`, `incremental-sync-engine`
- Supports: `map-architecture` workflow, `analyze-impact` workflow
- Feeds context to: `incremental-sync-engine` (Context sync)
- Integrates data from: `git-intelligence-engine`

This capability may write intelligence artifacts. It must not modify product code.
