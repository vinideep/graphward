# Codebase Discovery Engine

Autonomously explore and understand a codebase with minimal human interaction. The engine operates in four phases: automated discovery, hypothesis verification, targeted clarification, and confidence reporting. The goal is to build a comprehensive mental model of the project before asking any questions.

This capability does not modify product code.

## Context source and scope

Prefer GraphWard's persisted, verified intelligence over re-exploration. If initialization evidence exists, read `.graphward/context/initialization-evidence.json` and request `get_engineering_context` before scanning files. Apply the shared GraphWard project file policy to every discovery pass; record why a root/path was included or excluded. Graphify may corroborate structural hypotheses, and CCE may retrieve exact spans inside the GraphWard-approved neighborhood, but neither provider owns canonical conclusions.

If provider health is degraded, continue with native GraphWard extraction and report the fallback. Exclude stale, contested, unverifiable, secret-bearing, generated, vendored, provider-cache, and escaped-symlink evidence from high-confidence findings. Raw provider access is reserved for explicit expert mode.

## Inputs

- Repository root path (current working directory by default)
- Optional: scope constraints (specific package, service, directory, or monorepo workspace)
- Optional: depth limit (shallow = top-level only, deep = full recursive analysis)

## Outputs

- `.graphward/reports/DISCOVERY-report.md` — structured discovery findings with per-area confidence scores
- Feeds directly into `initialize-intelligence-skill` for knowledge base generation

---

## Phase 1: Automated Discovery (No User Interaction)

Execute ALL of the following scans silently. Do not prompt the user during this phase.

### 1.1 Repository Structure Scan

1. **File tree analysis** — Generate annotated directory tree (top 3 levels). Identify:
   - Source code directories vs configuration vs documentation vs generated output
   - Monorepo workspace boundaries
   - Hidden directories with significance (`.github`, `.gitlab`, `.circleci`, `.husky`, `.changeset`)
2. **File count distribution** — Count files by extension to determine primary and secondary languages
3. **Gitignore analysis** — Read `.gitignore` to understand build outputs, generated files, and secrets patterns
4. **Workspace root markers** — Identify the true project root vs nested project roots

### 1.2 Package Management Detection

Scan for ALL of the following package manifests and extract dependency information:

| Ecosystem | Manifest Files | Lock Files | What to Extract |

When a monorepo is detected:
- Enumerate all workspace packages/apps
- Identify shared libraries vs applications
- Map inter-package dependency graph
- Identify independent vs coupled packages

---

## Phase 2: Hypothesis Verification

After automated discovery, classify every finding by confidence level:

### Confidence Classification Rules

| Level | Score | Action | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HIGH** | >85% | State as fact with evidence | "The project uses Next.js 14 with App Router (evidence: `next.config.mjs`, `app/` directory structure, `next` v14.2.3 in package.json)" |
| **MEDIUM** | 50–85% | Present as belief with reasoning | "I believe the project uses a modular monolith pattern because modules communicate via direct imports rather than HTTP/events, and there are clear directory boundaries — correct?" |
| **LOW** | <50% | Ask a direct question | "I see Redis in docker-compose but no Redis client in dependencies. Is Redis used in production, or is it only for development?" |

### Confidence Scoring Heuristic

- **Config file explicitly declares it** → 95% confidence
- **Dependency present + matching file patterns** → 85% confidence
- **Dependency present but no matching usage found** → 60% confidence
- **File patterns suggest it but no dependency** → 50% confidence
- **Inferred from indirect evidence only** → 30% confidence
- **Single ambiguous signal** → 15% confidence

---

## Phase 3: Targeted Clarification (Maximum 5–10 Questions)

After Phases 1 and 2, ask ONLY questions that cannot be answered from code evidence. Group them into these categories:

### 3.1 Business Domain
- What is the core business domain? What problem does this solve for users?
- Are there domain-specific terms or jargon the team uses?

### 3.2 Deployment & Environments
- Where is this deployed? (cloud provider, region, multi-region?)
- What environments exist? (dev, staging, preview, production)
- What is the deployment process? (manual, CD, blue-green, canary)

### 3.3 Team Conventions
- What is the code review process? (required approvals, automated checks)
- What is the release cadence? (continuous, weekly, sprints)
- Are there unwritten rules not captured in linters or configs?

### 3.4 Pain Points & Tech Debt
- What areas of the codebase cause the most friction?
- Is there an active migration or refactoring effort?
- Are there known reliability or performance issues?

### 3.5 Future Direction
- What major changes are planned for the architecture?
- Are there technology migrations in progress or planned?

**Rules for clarification questions:**
- Never ask about something discoverable from code
- Never ask more than 10 questions total
- Group related questions together
- Provide your best guess alongside each question so the user can simply confirm or correct

## Procedure

1. **Scan repository structure** — Execute file tree analysis, file count distribution, and gitignore analysis from §1.1.

2. **Detect package management** — Scan for all manifest files from §1.2. Record ecosystem, versions, and dependency counts.

3. **Identify build system** — Check for all build tool indicators from §1.3. Note build commands from package scripts.

4. **Detect frameworks** — Cross-reference dependencies, config files, and file patterns from §1.4. Assign initial confidence scores.

5. **Detect data layer** — Scan for ORM configs, schema files, migration directories, and database connection patterns from §1.5.

6. **Detect authentication** — Look for auth libraries, middleware, token patterns, and role definitions from §1.6.

7. **Scan CI/CD** — Read all CI/CD configuration files from §1.7. Extract pipeline stages, triggers, and deployment targets.

8. **Scan infrastructure** — Identify containerization, orchestration, and IaC tools from §1.8.

9. **Detect testing setup** — Find test configs, test files, and coverage settings from §1.9. Identify testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e).

10. **Read existing documentation** — Extract knowledge from README, docs, ADRs, and changelogs from §1.10.

11. **Analyze git history** — Run hotspot analysis, contributor mapping, and change velocity calculations from §1.11.

12. **Check for monorepo** — Detect workspace tools and map package dependencies from §1.12.

13. **Map entry points** — Trace application entry points, routing, and middleware chains from discovered framework and config evidence.

14. **Build architecture hypothesis** — Synthesize findings into an architecture hypothesis: monolith vs microservices, layer boundaries, communication patterns.

15. **Classify confidence** — Apply confidence scoring from Phase 2 to every finding.

16. **Generate clarification questions** — Formulate 5-10 targeted questions from Phase 3 for areas with <50% confidence.

17. **Write DISCOVERY-report.md** — Generate the full report following the Phase 4 template.

18. **Present findings** — Share high-confidence facts, medium-confidence hypotheses (seeking confirmation), and low-confidence questions with the user.
