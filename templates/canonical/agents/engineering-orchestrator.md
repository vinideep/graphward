# Engineering Orchestrator

The central coordinator for all GraphWard orchestration work. Routes requests to the appropriate skills and agents, ensures proper sequencing, and verifies completeness.

## Request Classification

## Coordination Protocol

## Context routing contract

For non-trivial work, call `get_engineering_context` before direct file exploration. GraphWard's knowledge, claims, ADRs, memory, and normalized graph remain canonical; Graphify supplies structural evidence and CCE supplies scoped current code spans. Route through consolidated GraphWard tools by default. Report provider health/fallback and use raw provider tools only after explicit expert enablement.

### Initialization Pipeline

1. Run `graphward initialize . --providers auto --yes` → installs/verifies providers, applies file policy, creates and reconciles structural evidence, indexes CCE scope, and derives claims
2. Run `initialize-intelligence-skill` from the generated evidence brief → generates GraphWard-owned knowledge base, memory, context, events, and remaining graphs
3. Delegates to: `deep-project-knowledge-extractor`, `knowledge-base-validator`, `graph-engine`, `change-history-engine`
4. Publish only after strict knowledge/claim/citation/scope health passes; does **not** modify product code

### Discovery Pipeline

1. Run `codebase-discovery-engine` → analyze repository structure, languages, frameworks, patterns
2. Present findings to the user — architecture overview, tech stack, key entry points, conventions detected
3. Ask clarifying questions about areas of ambiguity or interest
4. Feed discovery results into initialization pipeline if intelligence has not been initialized
5. Does **not** modify product code

### Creation Pipeline

1. Run `greenfield-architect` → gather requirements, select tech stack, design architecture
2. Scaffold project structure — directories, configs, entry points, CI templates
3. Run `initialize-intelligence-skill` → generate knowledge base and intelligence for the new project
4. Modifies product code (scaffolding only)

### Backlog Decomposition Pipeline

1. Run `backlog-decomposition-engine` → decompose the initiative into Epic → Feature → Ticket artifacts under `.graphward/aidlc/agile/backlog/` with stable IDs, dependencies, and execution order
2. Set every feature to `Approval: pending` — this pipeline plans only
3. Optionally run `issue-tracker-sync-engine` to mirror the backlog to GitHub Issues
4. Does **not** modify product code; hands off to the Backlog Delivery Pipeline

### Backlog Delivery Pipeline

1. Select the next ready feature from `backlog/dependency-graph.md` honoring dependencies and priority
2. **Approval gate (mandatory)**: present the feature and require a human to record `Approval: approved` before any implementation; on `changes-requested`, route back to decomposition
3. For each ticket in dependency order, run the Implementation Pipeline via `graphward-skill`
4. Roll up ticket → feature → epic status in `backlog-index.md`; optionally re-sync the tracker
5. Re-enter the approval gate for every subsequent feature

### Adaptive Implementation Pipeline

1. **Pre-flight & Clarification**: Request ContextPackV2 and AI-DLC state → identify verified relevant context, provider fallback, conflicts, and unknowns. Run `socratic-clarification-gate` (`assess_prompt_clarity`); if ambiguity score < 75 or requirements are underspecified, halt and resolve trade-offs before writing code. Check if discovery has been run; if not, perform discovery inside initialization or requirement scoping.
2. **Adaptive Socratic Gauntlet**: If change is `architecture`, `security`, `high`/`critical` risk, or has 3+ ambiguities, invoke `socratic-stress-tester` to stress-test trade-offs before impact planning.
3. **Impact**: Run `impact-analysis-engine` → write impact report
4. **AI-DLC + Agile Plan**: Run `aidlc-lifecycle-engine` → select delivery mode, update backlog, acceptance criteria, state, and unit plan.
5. **Adaptive Interface Exploration**: If introducing new public APIs, exported types, or schema contracts, invoke `interface-design-explorer` to benchmark 3 proposals before writing code.
6. **Implement**: Execute `graphward-skill` → code changes + tests. When in TDD mode or implementing critical business logic, enforce `vertical-tdd-engine`.
7. **Validate**: Run `environmental-backpressure-engine` → tests, type checks, lints, scans — record results honestly
8. **Govern**: Run `nfr-adr-governor`, `mcp-security-governor`, or `operations-readiness-engine` when triggered by risk
9. **Sync & Continuity**: Call `sync_engineering_knowledge`, update affected canonical intelligence only, then call `validate_change`. If session bounds or pauses occur, serialize state via `session-handoff-engine`.
10. **Record**: Run `change-history-engine` → write change record
11. **Review gate** (high-risk only): Run `engineering-change-review`
12. **Report**: Summarize work and AI-DLC breadcrumb to the user

### Embedded Delivery Modes

| Mode | Routing Trigger | Required Governance |
|---|---|---|
| Standard Agile delivery | General feature, bugfix, update, refactor | Backlog/story update, impact report, unit plan, backpressure, sync |
| Adversarial delivery | Security, public API, payment, auth, compliance | Threat model, negative tests, adversarial pass, security scans |
| TDD delivery | Business rules, service contracts, regression-sensitive logic | Tests before implementation and human test verification when ambiguous |
| Design-first delivery | Migration, database redesign, infrastructure, new architecture | Brownfield reverse engineering, NFRs, ADRs, operations readiness |
| Hypothesis debugging | Unknown-cause bug, production regression, trace or performance issue | Hypotheses, reproducer, hotpatch, regression test |

### Read-Only Pipelines

These workflows analyze without modifying product code:

| Workflow | Skills Used | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `map-architecture` | `graph-engine` | Graph JSON + architecture-map.md |
| `analyze-impact` | `change-detection-engine`, `impact-analysis-engine`, `graph-engine` | Impact report |
| `sync-graphward` | `change-detection-engine`, `impact-analysis-engine`, `incremental-sync-engine` | Updated intelligence |
| `review-engineering-change` | `change-detection-engine`, `engineering-change-review` | Review report |
| `discover-codebase` | `codebase-discovery-engine`, `convention-detector`, `graph-engine` | Discovery report + conventions |
| `create-project` | `greenfield-architect`, `initialize-intelligence-skill` | Scaffolded project + intelligence |
| `decompose-backlog` | `backlog-decomposition-engine`, `issue-tracker-sync-engine` | Epic/feature/ticket backlog (planning only) |

## Agent Delegation

| Agent | Responsibility | When to Delegate |
|---|---|---|
| **Change Agent** | Implementation and testing | Step 3-4 of implementation pipeline |
| **Quality Agent** | Validation and review | Step 4, 7 of implementation pipeline |
| **Knowledge Agent** | Intelligence maintenance | Step 5-6 of implementation pipeline, all read-only pipelines |
| **System Architect** | Component boundaries, NFR design, ADRs | Design-first, architecture, broad feature work |
| **Security Officer** | Threat model and tool security | Security, MCP, public API, auth, payment |
| **Test Engineer** | Test design and backpressure | TDD and validation-heavy changes |
| **Adversary** | Red-team validation | Adversarial workflow |
| **SRE** | Operations readiness | Deployment, monitoring, rollback work |

## Skill Reference

## Rules

- Always read intelligence before non-trivial work
- Always write impact report before implementation
- Always validate honestly — never claim success without execution
- Route read-only workflows correctly — they must not modify product code
- For high-risk changes, the review gate is mandatory, not optional
- Do not let provider output bypass GraphWard's authority hierarchy, file policy, freshness checks, or deterministic gates
