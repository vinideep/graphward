# Staleness Detector

Monitor the freshness of all GraphWard intelligence documents by comparing their last-updated timestamps against the modification times of the source files they describe. Produce a freshness report and trigger incremental sync for stale documents.

**Run the deterministic scorer first:** `npx gw freshness . [--threshold 60] [--json]` computes each document's 0-100 freshness from its cited evidence paths and their git history, and writes the report. Documents with no citations are reported `unverifiable` rather than fresh. Use the steps below to act on that output, not to recompute it by hand.

This capability does not modify product code.

## Inputs

- Repository root path
- Knowledge base directory (`.graphward/knowledge-base/`)
- Memory directory (`.graphward/memory/`)
- Context directory (`.graphward/context/`)
- Optional: specific document or module to check
- Optional: custom freshness threshold (default: 60)

## Procedure

0. **Use the CLI first (saves ~2,000 tokens)** — Before computing freshness manually, run:

   ```bash
   npx gw freshness .
   ```

   This runs the deterministic staleness formula in milliseconds and writes `.graphward/reports/FRESHNESS-report.md`. If the report exists and was generated within the last 10 minutes, **read it directly and skip steps 1–8**. The Pre-Implementation Drift Decision in the report replaces manual computation.

   Only fall through to steps 1–8 if the CLI is unavailable.

1. **Inventory knowledge documents** — Enumerate all documents in:
   - `.graphward/knowledge-base/*.md` (00 through 16)
   - `.graphward/memory/*.md`
   - `.graphward/context/*.md`
   - `.graphward/graph/*.json`

   For each document, extract:
   - Document path
   - Last modified timestamp (from filesystem or frontmatter `last_updated` field)
   - Evidence citations within the document (file paths referenced)

2. **Extract evidence dependencies** — For each knowledge document, parse all evidence citations to build a dependency map:

   ```markdown
   ## Document Dependencies

   | Document | Depends On (Source Files) |
   |---|---|
   | `02-architecture.md` | `src/app/`, `src/server/`, `next.config.mjs` |
   | `05-database.md` | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/db/`, `migrations/` |
   | `06-authentication.md` | `src/auth/`, `auth.config.ts`, `middleware.ts` |
   ```

3. **Check source file modification times** — For each source file referenced by a knowledge document:
   - Get the file's last modification time via `git log -1 --format=%cI -- <path>` (preferred) or filesystem mtime
   - Compare against the knowledge document's last-updated timestamp
   - Track files that no longer exist (deleted or moved)

4. **Calculate freshness score** — Score each document 0–100 using this formula:

   ```
   base_score = 100

   For each referenced source file:
     days_since_doc_update = (now - document_last_updated).days
     days_since_file_change = (now - file_last_modified).days

     if file was modified AFTER document was last updated:
       staleness_penalty = min(30, (file_modified - doc_updated).days * 3)
       base_score -= staleness_penalty

     if file no longer exists:
       base_score -= 25  (major structural change)

     if file was renamed/moved (detected via git):
       base_score -= 15  (references are broken)

   age_penalty = min(20, days_since_doc_update * 0.5)
   base_score -= age_penalty

   freshness_score = max(0, base_score)
   ```

   **Score interpretation:**

   | Score | Status | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | 80–100 | 🟢 Fresh | Document is current and reliable |
   | 60–79 | 🟡 Aging | Document may have minor inaccuracies |
   | 40–59 | 🟠 Stale | Document likely has outdated information |
   | 20–39 | 🔴 Very Stale | Document is unreliable, needs re-generation |
   | 0–19 | ⛔ Obsolete | Document may be misleading, urgent refresh needed |

5. **Add freshness metadata** — Inject or update a frontmatter block at the top of each knowledge document:

   ```markdown
   <!-- freshness: score=75, status=aging, last_checked=2024-01-20T14:30:00Z -->
   <!-- stale_sources: src/auth/middleware.ts (modified 5 days after doc update) -->
   ```

   Rules for metadata injection:
   - If a `<!-- freshness: -->` comment already exists, update it in place
   - If no freshness comment exists, add it after the document title (first `#` heading)
   - Never modify document content — only metadata comments

   Also add section-level confidence metadata to each H2 section when evidence can be resolved:

   ```markdown
   ## Authentication Flow
   <!-- section-confidence: level=high, score=91, verified_at=2026-06-04T10:00:00Z, evidence=src/auth/middleware.ts -->
   ```

   Agents must prefer high/medium confidence sections and skip low-confidence sections unless they verify the section against source first.

6. **Determine sync actions** — Based on freshness scores, determine required actions:

   | Condition | Action |
   |---|---|
   | Score < threshold (default 60) | Queue for incremental sync via `incremental-sync-engine` |
   | Score < 30 | Flag as critical in report, recommend full re-generation |
   | Referenced file deleted | Flag structural change, recommend manual review |
   | Referenced file moved | Update evidence citations, re-verify claims |
   | Multiple documents stale for same module | Recommend module-level re-discovery |

7. **Generate FRESHNESS-report.md** — Write to `.graphward/reports/FRESHNESS-report.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Freshness Report

   Generated: <timestamp>
   Threshold: <score>
   Documents scanned: <N>

   ## Summary

   | Status | Count | Percentage |
   |---|---|---|
   | 🟢 Fresh (80-100) | <N> | <N%> |
   | 🟡 Aging (60-79) | <N> | <N%> |
   | 🟠 Stale (40-59) | <N> | <N%> |
   | 🔴 Very Stale (20-39) | <N> | <N%> |
   | ⛔ Obsolete (0-19) | <N> | <N%> |

   ## Document Scores

   | Document | Score | Status | Stale Sources | Last Updated | Action Needed |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | `02-architecture.md` | 45 | 🟠 Stale | `src/app/layout.tsx` (+3d) | 2024-01-10 | Incremental sync |
   | `05-database.md` | 90 | 🟢 Fresh | — | 2024-01-18 | None |
   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

   ## Structural Changes

   | Type | File | Affected Documents |
   |---|---|---|
   | Deleted | `src/old-auth/handler.ts` | `06-authentication.md` |
   | Moved | `src/utils.ts` → `src/lib/utils.ts` | `01-repository-structure.md` |

   ## Recommended Actions

   1. **Critical** — Re-generate: <list of documents with score < 30>
   2. **High** — Incremental sync: <list of documents with score < 60>
   3. **Medium** — Review: <list of documents with score 60-79>
   4. **Structural** — Manual review needed: <list of deleted/moved file impacts>

   ## Module-Level Freshness

   | Module | Avg Document Score | Documents Below Threshold |
   |---|---|---|
   | auth | 42 | `06-authentication.md`, `context/critical-paths.md` |
   | api | 88 | — |
   | ... | ... | ... |
   ```

8. **Trigger incremental sync** — For documents below the threshold, invoke `incremental-sync-engine` with:
   - The specific document to update
   - The list of changed source files
   - The staleness reason (file modified, file deleted, file moved, age)

9. **Pre-Implementation Drift Trigger** — When invoked by `graphward-skill`, return a blocking drift decision:

   | Condition | Decision |
   |---|---|
   | All scoped artifacts >= 60 | Proceed |
   | Any scoped artifact 50-59 | Sync before implementation or mark stale risk in impact report |
   | Any scoped artifact < 50 | Block implementation until incremental sync or explicit user risk acceptance |
