# GraphWard Implementation

The core implementation skill for engineering work. Use after project intelligence has been initialized.

## Inputs

- User request describing the desired change
- Repository with initialized intelligence (`.graphward/knowledge-base/`, `.graphward/`)

## Request Classification

Classify the incoming request before starting:

| Type | Description | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|
| `feature` | New user-facing functionality | Medium–High |
| `bugfix` | Correction of incorrect behavior; auth, data, API, or trust-boundary fixes escalate to High | Low–High |
| `update` | Dependency, config, or version updates; security/runtime changes escalate to High | Low–High |
| `refactor` | Structural improvement without behavior change | Medium |
| `architecture` | Boundary, layer, or pattern changes | High |
| `infrastructure` | CI, deployment, environment changes | Medium–High |
| `security` | Auth, permissions, vulnerability fixes | High |
| `documentation` | Knowledge-only changes (no product code) | Low |

## Depth Level

Determine execution depth from the user's request before proceeding. Risk always overrides requested speed: Minimal depth may omit optional analysis but never an applicable mandatory gate.

| Signal words | Depth | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| "minimal", "quick", "sketch", "spike", "prototype" | **Minimal** | Skip optional analysis only; mandatory gates still follow actual risk; lightweight impact report |
| (default — no explicit signal) | **Standard** | Full procedure; all applicable gates; incremental sync after changes |
| "comprehensive", "thorough", "production-critical" | **Comprehensive** | All gates mandatory; extended scope analysis; full intelligence sync; cross-reference all ADRs |

Record the depth on line 2 of the impact report header. For **Minimal** depth, list which gates were skipped and why.

**Context gate (Standard and Comprehensive):** On high-risk or architecture-level changes, commit only share-safe, tracked lifecycle artifacts and the current execution plan before implementation. Never force-add ignored knowledge, graph, claims, context, or reports unless the project explicitly opted into shared intelligence.

## Procedure

### 0. Pre-Flight: Load User Profile (pinned, ~50t)

Before reading any project intelligence:

1. Run `npx gw user-profile .` if the profile doesn't yet exist.
2. Resolve identity: `git config user.email` → `.graphward/memory/users/<slug>/user-intelligence.md`.
3. Skip if CI environment detected (`$CI`, `$GITHUB_ACTIONS`, etc.).
4. Load the **Active Predictions block only** (~50t) and apply immediately:
   - Test generation policy (always / on-request / inferred-rarely)
   - Implementation depth (spike / standard / production-hardened)
   - Response format (terse / standard / detailed)
   - Type safety policy (strict / follow-conventions)
5. For any dimension not set in the personal profile, check `team-preferences.md`.

This calibrates the entire workflow before a single line of code is written or read.

### 1. Pre-Flight: Read Intelligence

Use `context-budget-optimizer` and call `get_engineering_context` before loading broad intelligence or opening source files. Treat its ContextPackV2 route, trust state, graph neighborhood, evidence hashes, conflicts, provider fallbacks, required gates, and stop reason as the pre-flight contract. Do not read all of `.graphward/knowledge-base/` or all graph JSON by default. Build `.graphward/context/context-manifest.md`, then load only relevant slices:
- `.graphward/knowledge-base/` — only H2 sections relevant to the changed modules, APIs, schemas, or risk areas
- `.graphward/aidlc/` — `aidlc-state.md`, active checkpoint, active unit, acceptance criteria, and execution-plan rows relevant to the request
- `.graphward/memory/` — only matching decisions, constraints, conventions, regression patterns, and ADR references
- `.graphward/context/` — module/service/runtime rows near the change scope
- `.graphward/graph/` — only relevant nodes/edges by graph proximity

**If intelligence is missing or stale**: Run `initialize-intelligence-skill` first. When only a provider is unavailable, continue with the pack's native fallback and report degradation; never bypass stale GraphWard knowledge by trusting provider output directly.

Token rule: keep initial intelligence loading under 40% of the available context budget whenever possible. Lazy-load safety-gate evidence only when the trigger applies.

#### Pre-Flight Freshness Gate

Before impact analysis or code edits:

1. Resolve the likely changed modules from the request, graph proximity, or `change-detection-engine`.
2. Run `staleness-detector` scoped to those modules and related knowledge/context/memory artifacts.
3. If any freshness score is below `60`, run `incremental-sync-engine` for the stale artifacts before editing product code, or explicitly mark stale context in the impact report with the affected documents and scores.
4. If any score is below `50`, implementation is blocked until incremental sync runs or the user explicitly accepts stale-context risk.
5. Use the `staleness-detector` **Pre-Implementation Drift Trigger** decision: `Proceed`, `Sync before implementation`, or `Block implementation`.
6. Carry that exact decision into the impact report's freshness-gate line.
7. Skip stale H2 sections that carry low confidence metadata unless they are refreshed or verified against source.

### 2. Adaptive Pre-Flight Socratic Gauntlet

Before finalizing the impact analysis and planning:
- **Clarity Gate**: Call `assess_prompt_clarity` on the user prompt. If clarity score < 75 or blocking ambiguities exist, invoke `socratic-clarification-gate` to resolve them before proceeding. If score ≥ 75 and no blocking ambiguities, proceed directly.
- **Trigger**: When the request is classified as `architecture`, `security`, cross-cutting (`high`/`critical` risk), or contains 3+ open ambiguities.
- **Action**: Run `socratic-stress-tester` to challenge edge cases, failure/rollback modes, non-functional requirements, and blast radius.
- **Output**: Record confirmed assumptions vs. verified facts (`[VERIFIED: path#lines]`) in the impact report before writing code.
- **Skip Condition**: Skip for localized bugfixes, updates, and low-risk changes with clear specifications.

### 3. Impact Analysis: Write Report

Before any code edit, write `.graphward/reports/IMP-XXX-<summary>.md`. Call `analyze_change_impact` to compute direct and indirect impact programmatically, then incorporate its output into the report.

```markdown
# IMP-XXX: <summary>

## Classification
- Type: <feature|bugfix|update|refactor|architecture|infrastructure|security>
- Risk: <low|medium|high|critical>
- Scope: <files and modules affected>

```

### 4. Implement the Change

- Select the adaptive delivery mode inside the existing GraphWard workflow:
  - Standard Agile delivery for normal feature, bugfix, update, and refactor work
  - Adversarial delivery for auth, payment, public API, secrets, or compliance-sensitive work
  - TDD delivery for high-reliability business rules and service contracts
  - Design-first delivery for migrations, new architecture, and broad system boundaries
  - Hypothesis debugging for unknown-cause defects

#### Adaptive Interface Contract Exploration
- **Trigger**: When the request introduces new public APIs, exported types, schema models, or SDK contracts.
- **Action**: Run `interface-design-explorer` to draft and compare 3 contrasting proposals (*Minimalist*, *Type-Safe/Extensible*, *Performance-Optimized*) before writing production code.
- **Skip Condition**: Skip when modifying existing internal function bodies or bugfixes.

- Update Agile artifacts when product behavior is in scope:
  - `.graphward/aidlc/agile/product-backlog.md`
  - `.graphward/aidlc/agile/sprint-plan.md`
  - `.graphward/aidlc/agile/acceptance-criteria.md`
  - `.graphward/aidlc/agile/definition-of-ready.md`
  - `.graphward/aidlc/agile/definition-of-done.md`
- Update `.graphward/aidlc/execution-plan.md` and call `update_aidlc_state` to transition the AI-DLC lifecycle
- Split broad changes into construction units and keep `.graphward/aidlc/construction/cross-unit-discoveries.md` current
- Edit only the files necessary for the request
- Follow existing coding patterns from `.graphward/memory/coding-patterns.md`
- Read conventions from `.graphward/knowledge-base/16-conventions.md` and `.graphward/memory/coding-patterns.md` — match naming patterns, import style, error handling patterns, and code structure
- If conventions document is missing or outdated, run `convention-detector` first
- After generating or modifying each file, compare it against `coding-patterns.md` for naming, import order, error handling, logging, folder structure, test style, and framework idioms. Auto-correct minor violations. Structural convention violations become review findings and block completion when critical.
- Respect architectural boundaries from `.graphward/memory/architecture-decisions.md`
- Consult `dangerous-areas.md` before modifying flagged code

#### Adaptive Vertical TDD Execution
- **Trigger**: When TDD delivery mode is selected, or when implementing complex business rules, parsers, state machines, or auth logic.
- **Action**: Use `vertical-tdd-engine` to write vertical slice tests against public interfaces first (RED), write minimal passing code (GREEN), and clean code under tests (REFACTOR). Save failing output in `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/build-and-test/build-and-test-summary.md`.
- If this sequence is skipped, mark the construction unit blocked unless the user explicitly approves non-TDD execution.

### 5. Add/Update Tests

- Add tests proportional to the change risk level
- Map each acceptance criterion to at least one automated test, manual verification step, or explicitly recorded unavailable check
- For `bugfix`: add a regression test reproducing the original issue
- For `feature`: add unit tests and integration tests for the new behavior
- For `architecture`/`security`: add boundary and negative-path tests
- Run the project's test suite and record actual results

### 6. Validate

- Run linters, type checks, and test suites available in the project
- Use environmental backpressure: analyze failed diagnostics, fix, and rerun the relevant command until it passes or a blocker is recorded
- Run `type-safety-engine` for typed projects or record why no type system applies
- Run `api-backward-compatibility-engine` when API, event, webhook, SDK, route, or schema contracts changed — it also captures/replays response snapshots when API behavior can be sampled
- Run `database-migration-safety-engine` when schema, ORM model, migration, index, or data persistence contracts changed
- Run `security-audit-engine` when auth/authz, secrets, cryptography, sessions, untrusted input, public endpoints, LLM/MCP trust boundaries, or dependencies change. Use deterministic scanners where available; report `unavailable` rather than inventing CVE, license, or maintenance claims. Unwaived high/critical findings block completion.
- Run `environment-variable-auditor` when environment variable reads, validation schemas, deployment config, or CI secrets change
- Run `adr-compliance-checker` when accepted ADRs or architecture decisions apply to the changed area
- Run `llm-prompt-injection-guard` when user-controlled data reaches prompts, RAG, agent tools, LLM calls, or durable AI memory
- Write `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/build-and-test/build-and-test-summary.md` for non-trivial units
- **Never claim validation passed unless it actually ran and passed**
- Record partial or failed validation honestly
- `validate_change` runs the executable registry for env vars, dead exports, API diffs/snapshots, migrations, security, rollback, and conventions, reporting each as pass, warn, fail, skipped, or unavailable. Type checks, acceptance mapping, dependency scanning, ADR review, freshness, and LLM prompt-injection review remain separately named evidence; never imply the registry executed them. A required unavailable registry gate blocks medium/high-risk completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria Verification Matrix

Before Definition of Done can pass, map every criterion from `.graphward/aidlc/agile/acceptance-criteria.md` to evidence:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria Verification Matrix
| Criterion | Evidence Type | Evidence | Result | Open Item |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Given..., when..., then... | automated test | `test/file.test.ts` / command result | pass | — |
| ... | manual verification | <steps required> | pending | <owner/reason> |
```

Missing mappings block the Done gate and must be copied into the CHG record as open items.

### 7. Incremental Sync & Session Continuity

Call `sync_engineering_knowledge` after edits, then use `incremental-sync-engine` to update only the affected canonical prose and durable artifacts it flags:
- Knowledge docs reflecting changed behavior
- Memory entries if decisions/patterns changed
- Context maps if module/service topology changed
- Graph nodes/edges if dependencies or services changed
- Event guidance if API/schema/auth contracts changed
- AI-DLC lifecycle artifacts if state, plan, NFRs, ADRs, operations readiness, or unit discoveries changed
- Agile artifacts if backlog, story status, acceptance criteria, Ready/Done gates, or retrospective learning changed

Run `validate_change` after synchronization. Completion requires current graph/index evidence, re-derived claims, applicable deterministic gates, and explicit reporting of any unavailable provider or validation. Provider caches are disposable; GraphWard artifacts remain durable authority.

#### Adaptive Session Handoff Trigger
- **Trigger**: When context window limits approach, work is paused across sessions, or task is transferred to another agent.
- **Action**: Run `session-handoff-engine` to emit `.graphward/handoffs/HO-<date>-<task>.md` with ground truth, modified files, and immediate next commands.

### 8. Record Change

Create `.graphward/changes/CHG-XXX-<summary>.md`:

### 9. High-Risk Review Gate

For changes classified as `high` or `critical` risk:
- Run `engineering-change-review` before final reporting
- Address any blocking findings before marking complete

### 10. Report

Summarize to the user:
- Code changes made (files, lines)
- Tests run and results
- Affected systems and services
- Synchronized intelligence artifacts
- Unresolved risks or follow-ups
- Final AI-DLC breadcrumb: `AI-DLC: <phase> -> <stage> -> <status>`

## Rules

- **Never vibe-code** — Do not edit files directly without first recording the change in the impact report. If an urgent direct edit is unavoidable, log the file and reason in the impact report's "direct edits" section and update design artifacts before marking the work done.
- Always write the impact report before any code edit.
- Never claim validation passed unless it actually ran and passed.
- Record partial or failed validation honestly.

## Cross-References

- Depends on: `initialize-intelligence-skill` (prerequisite), `context-budget-optimizer`, `change-detection-engine`, `impact-analysis-engine`, `graph-engine`, `staleness-detector`
