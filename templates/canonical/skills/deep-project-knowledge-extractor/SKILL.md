# Deep Project Knowledge Extractor

Produce comprehensive, evidence-backed project documentation by systematic repository analysis. Every material claim must cite a source file path. Silence is never acceptable — use `**Not detected**` for absent features.

## Inputs

- Repository root path
- Optional: scope constraints (specific package, service, or directory)

## Discovery Checklist

Scan the repository systematically for each category:

| Category | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| **Package Management** | `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, workspace configs |
| **Build System** | `Makefile`, `webpack.config.*`, `vite.config.*`, `tsconfig.json`, `build.gradle` |
| **Entrypoints** | `main.*`, `index.*`, `app.*`, `server.*`, bin scripts |
| **Routing** | Express/Koa/Fastify routes, Next.js pages/app dirs, API gateways |
| **Database** | Migration dirs, schema files, ORM configs, seed scripts |
| **Auth** | Passport/Auth0/JWT configs, middleware, RBAC definitions |
| **CI/CD** | `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `Dockerfile` |
| **Infrastructure** | `docker-compose.yml`, `terraform/`, `k8s/`, `serverless.yml` |
| **Tests** | `test/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, test configs |
| **Environment** | `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, env validation schemas |
| **Documentation** | `README.md`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` |

## Output Specification

Generate each document in `.graphward/knowledge-base/` with this structure:

```markdown
# <Document Title>

<One-paragraph executive summary>

## <Section>

<Content with inline evidence citations>

(evidence: path/to/file:L42-L58)

## Unknowns & Uncertainties

- <what is unclear and why>
```

## Evidence Rules

1. Every architectural claim must cite at least one source file
2. Use the format: `(evidence: relative/path/to/file:L<line>)` or `(evidence: relative/path/to/file)`
3. When evidence is indirect (inferred from patterns), use: `(inferred from: path/to/file)`
4. When no evidence exists: `**Not detected** — no relevant configuration or code found`
5. When evidence is ambiguous: `**Unclear from evidence** — [explanation of ambiguity]`

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All 16 documents generated (00 through 15)
- [ ] Every document has an executive summary paragraph
- [ ] Every material claim has an evidence citation
- [ ] Absent features use `**Not detected**` — not silence
- [ ] Ambiguous areas use `**Unclear from evidence**`
- [ ] No invented implementation details

## Cross-References
