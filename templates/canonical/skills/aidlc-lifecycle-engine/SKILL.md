# AI-DLC Lifecycle Engine

Use this skill inside the existing GraphWard workflows. It is not a separate command family. It turns Agile intent into an adaptive, artifact-driven delivery path while preserving familiar Agile concepts: vision, backlog, user stories, acceptance criteria, sprint planning, implementation, review, release readiness, and retrospective learning.

## Runtime Artifacts

Use `.graphward/aidlc/` as the canonical AI-DLC root:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.graphward/aidlc/aidlc-state.md` | Active phase, stage, workflow, hat, unit, and completion status |
| `.graphward/aidlc/audit.md` | Append-only chronological log of decisions, user answers, tool checks, and transitions |
| `.graphward/aidlc/open-questions.md` | Unresolved ambiguities and owner/status |
| `.graphward/aidlc/execution-plan.md` | Adaptive stage plan with mandatory/conditional/skipped stages |
| `.graphward/aidlc/checkpoints.md` | Resume checkpoints after major workflow steps |
| `.graphward/aidlc/discovery/vision.md` | Business objectives, personas, value, success metrics |
| `.graphward/aidlc/discovery/technical-environment.md` | Runtime, deployment, integrations, data stores, auth, constraints |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/product-backlog.md` | High-level epics, priorities, dependencies, and status |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/backlog/` | Hierarchical Epic → Feature → Ticket backlog with stable IDs, dependency graph, and per-feature approval gates, owned by `backlog-decomposition-engine` |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/sprint-plan.md` | Active sprint goal, selected stories, capacity, risks, and commitments |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/acceptance-criteria.md` | Story-level acceptance criteria expressed as executable validation targets |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/definition-of-ready.md` | Readiness checklist before construction |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/definition-of-done.md` | Completion checklist after validation and sync |
| `.graphward/aidlc/agile/retrospective.md` | Lessons, process improvements, recurring risks, and follow-ups |
| `.graphward/aidlc/inception/requirements.md` | Validated functional requirements and edge cases |
| `.graphward/aidlc/inception/reverse-engineering/` | Brownfield architecture, API, code structure, component inventory, technology stack |
| `.graphward/aidlc/construction/cross-unit-discoveries.md` | Shared discoveries from parallel or sequential units |
| `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/` | Unit functional design, NFR design, ADRs, code plan, build/test evidence |
| `.graphward/aidlc/operations/` | Deployment readiness, observability, runbooks, rollback notes |

These AI-DLC files complement `.graphward/knowledge-base/`, `.graphward/memory/`, `.graphward/context/`, `.graphward/graph/`, `.graphward/reports/`, and `.graphward/changes/`.

## MCP Tools

Use these tools instead of manually editing AI-DLC markdown files. Manual markdown edits desynchronize `aidlc-state.json`.

| Tool | Purpose | When to Call |
|---|---|---|
| `get_aidlc_state` | Read current lifecycle position, phase, stage, active unit, and breadcrumb | Before any phase transition or checkpoint resume |
| `update_aidlc_state` | Transition phase, stage, hat, unit, and breadcrumb (writes JSON + projects to markdown) | After every major step, checkpoint, or phase transition |
| `check_aidlc_gate` | Programmatically validate whether the repository satisfies exit criteria for a phase (`discovery`, `inception`, `construction`, `operations`) | Before transitioning to the next phase |
| `assess_prompt_clarity` | Assess prompt ambiguity and missing NFRs | During Discovery or Inception when user intent is unclear |
| `freeze_clarified_requirements` | Lock user-selected decisions into `inception/requirements.md` | After user answers clarification questions |

### Gate Failure Handling

When `check_aidlc_gate` returns `status: "blocked"`:
1. Read the `blockers` array from the response.
2. For each blocker, determine if it requires user input or can be resolved programmatically.
3. Do NOT proceed to the next phase. Record blockers in `audit.md` and either resolve them or present them to the user.
4. Re-run `check_aidlc_gate` after resolution to confirm the gate passes.

## Embedded Agile + AI-DLC Model

Map Agile to AI-DLC this way:

| Agile Concept | AI-DLC Phase | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Product vision | Discovery | `discovery/vision.md` |
| Product backlog | Discovery / Inception | `agile/product-backlog.md`, `agile/backlog/` |
| Epic → Feature → Ticket breakdown | Inception | `agile/backlog/` via `backlog-decomposition-engine` |
| User stories | Inception | `inception/requirements.md`, `agile/backlog/features/` |
| Acceptance criteria | Inception / Construction | `agile/acceptance-criteria.md`, tests |
| Sprint planning | Inception | `agile/sprint-plan.md`, `execution-plan.md` |
| Development | Construction | `construction/<unit>/` |
| Daily inspection | Construction | `aidlc-state.md`, `audit.md`, `cross-unit-discoveries.md` |
| Sprint review | Construction / Operations | validation summary, review report |
| Release | Operations | `operations/operations-readiness.md` |
| Retrospective | Operations | `agile/retrospective.md` |

## Adaptive Phase Model

### 0. Discovery

Use when project intent, deployment environment, ownership, or constraints are unclear.

Outputs:
- `discovery/vision.md`
- `discovery/technical-environment.md`
- `open-questions.md`

Ask role-aware questions. For multiple-choice questions in Markdown, put a blank line between options so strict CommonMark renderers keep options readable. Convert answers into backlog items, user stories, acceptance criteria, and open questions.

### 1. Inception

Always run workspace detection. Classify the repository as `greenfield` or `brownfield`.

Workspace detection procedure:
1. Check for source directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `packages/`).
2. Check for package manifests (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`).
3. If source directories AND manifests exist with meaningful code: `brownfield`.
4. If repo is empty or has only scaffolding: `greenfield`.
5. Call `update_aidlc_state` with `stage: "workspace-classified"` and record the classification in `discovery/technical-environment.md`.

For brownfield systems, run reverse engineering and write:
- `business-overview.md`
- `architecture.md`
- `code-structure.md`
- `api-documentation.md`
- `component-inventory.md`
- `technology-stack.md`

Then compile validated requirements, backlog updates, acceptance criteria, sprint plan, and an adaptive `execution-plan.md`.

`execution-plan.md` must include a formal unit dependency graph:

```markdown
## Units Dependency Graph
| Unit | Depends On | Can Run In Parallel | Files Owned | Conflict Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
```

Units with no declared dependencies and no overlapping owned files may run in parallel. Conflicts discovered during parallel or sequential execution must be logged in `cross-unit-discoveries.md`.

### 2. Construction

Execute per unit of work. Each unit may include:
- Functional design
- NFR requirements
- NFR design
- Infrastructure design
- Code generation plan
- Build and test summary

Before starting each unit, read `cross-unit-discoveries.md`. If new constraints appear, append finding, impact, and action taken.

### 3. Operations

Use when deployment, infrastructure, observability, or production readiness is in scope. Produce readiness evidence, rollback guidance, alert thresholds, and runbooks.

## Delivery Mode Selection

Within `/graphward`, choose a delivery mode:

| Mode | Use When | Required Hats |
|---|---|---|
| Standard Agile Delivery | General feature, bugfix, refactor, or update | Product Analyst, System Architect, Component Builder, Test Engineer, Documentation Writer |
| Adversarial Delivery | Auth, payment, public API, data exposure, critical business rules | Security Officer, Adversary, Compliance Auditor, Test Engineer |
| TDD Delivery | High-reliability business logic or service contracts | Product Analyst, Test Engineer, Component Builder |
| Design-First Delivery | Major migrations, new architecture, data model redesign | System Architect, Database Administrator, Security Officer, Compliance Auditor |
| Hypothesis Debugging | Production bugs, regressions, memory leaks, trace failures | Orchestration Lead, Performance Analyst, SRE, Component Builder |

## Objective Completion Criteria

Each stage must end with binary evidence:
- Artifact exists at the expected path
- Story is Ready before implementation and Done before completion
- Unknowns are recorded or resolved
- Required tests, type checks, linters, scans, or build commands ran, failed, or were explicitly unavailable
- Human approval is recorded before irreversible actions
- Breadcrumb is updated via `update_aidlc_state` with `breadcrumb: "AI-DLC: <phase> -> <stage> -> <status>"`
- Checkpoint is written after impact analysis, implementation, type/API/migration safety gates, validation, synchronization, and change record

## Checkpoint And Resume

Write `.graphward/aidlc/checkpoints.md` and call `update_aidlc_state` after each major step:

| Checkpoint | Meaning | Resume Action |
|---|---|---|
| `impact-analysis-complete` | Impact report exists | Resume at implementation planning |
| `implementation-complete` | Code edits are done | Resume at validation |
| `safety-gates-complete` | Type/API/migration gates passed or blocked | Resume at testing/backpressure |
| `tests-passing` | Required validation passed | Resume at sync |
| `sync-complete` | Intelligence artifacts updated | Resume at change record |
| `change-record-complete` | CHG record exists | Resume at final report |

On re-invocation, detect the latest checkpoint and continue from the next step instead of restarting, unless the user asks for a fresh run.

## Dry-Run Mode

If the user asks for dry run, preview, or plan-only execution:
- Generate the impact report
- Select delivery mode
- Show files likely to change and why
- Run safe current-state checks such as type/lint/test discovery
- Do not edit product code
- Write a pre-flight report under `.graphward/reports/`

## Environmental Backpressure

Use compilers, strict linters, type systems, test suites, security scanners, architecture checks, and local reproducer scripts as direct feedback. When a tool fails, analyze the raw diagnostic output, revise the implementation, and rerun the relevant check until the issue is resolved or a concrete blocker is logged.

## Progress Breadcrumb

End AI-DLC-enabled workflow responses with one compact status line:

```text
AI-DLC: <phase> -> <stage> -> <status>
```

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Workspace is classified as greenfield or brownfield
- [ ] Brownfield reverse engineering exists before broad changes
- [ ] Requirements and execution plan are durable files
- [ ] Construction is split into explicit units
- [ ] Unit dependency graph exists in `execution-plan.md`
- [ ] Cross-unit discoveries are loaded and updated
- [ ] Checkpoints are written and resume is supported
- [ ] Validation uses environmental backpressure
- [ ] Operations readiness is addressed when deployment or production behavior changes
