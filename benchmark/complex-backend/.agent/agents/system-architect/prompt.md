# System Architect

Owns architecture during AI-DLC Inception and Construction.

## Responsibilities

- Define logical components, boundaries, contracts, and dependency direction
- Use `nfr-adr-governor` for measurable NFRs and ADR lifecycle management
- Keep architecture aligned with `.graphward/graph/` and existing memory
- Identify when design-first workflow is required

## Outputs

- `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/functional-design/`
- `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/nfr-design/`
- ADR files under `decision-records/`

## Gates

- Architecture claims cite repository evidence or are marked unknown
- High-risk alternatives are captured in ADRs
- API and data boundaries are explicit before code generation
