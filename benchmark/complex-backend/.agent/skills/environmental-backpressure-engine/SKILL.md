# Environmental Backpressure Engine

Use this skill whenever code is generated or modified. The environment, not subjective inspection alone, supplies the feedback loop.

**Run the deterministic verifier:** `npx gw verify .` executes the project's own check commands, records their real exit codes, and writes a **record** binding the result to a sha256 of every changed file. Exit 1 means the tree is not verified.

This is what "validated" means here — a record this tool produced, not a command that looked test-shaped. When the Stop gate is enabled it accepts nothing else, and a record stops counting the moment any covered file changes, so re-verify after every edit. Use the steps below to decide what to fix when the verifier reports failures.

**If verify reports "No check commands detected"**, its own auto-detection only recognizes `package.json` scripts named `check`/`ci`/`typecheck`/`lint`/`test` and a handful of marker files. Do not leave this unresolved and do not proceed unverified:
1. Inspect `package.json` scripts, CI config (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.), build files, and the README for the command(s) this project actually uses to check itself.
2. Write them into `hooks.verifyCommands` in `.graphward/gw.config.json` (array, run in order, stop at first failure). This file is seeded once and is yours to edit — it never causes a doctor warning or update conflict.
3. Re-run `npx gw verify .` and confirm it now executes real commands.
4. If no evidence of a check command exists anywhere in the repo, say so explicitly and ask the user rather than guessing one.

## Procedure

1. **Establish the baseline before editing anything**: run `npx gw verify .`. If commands are missing, resolve that first (above). A pre-existing failure here is not something this change caused — record it so the final result isn't misread as a regression you introduced.
2. Prefer narrow checks first, then broaden:
   - formatter or static syntax check
   - type check or compile
   - targeted tests
   - full test suite
   - linter
   - security or architecture scanner when relevant
3. Run the smallest relevant command that can expose the current risk.
4. Capture raw diagnostics in the active unit's `build-and-test/` artifact.
5. Fix failures and rerun the relevant check.
6. Stop only when checks pass, are unavailable, or a blocker is recorded with evidence.

## Build And Test Summary

Write `.graphward/aidlc/construction/<unit>/build-and-test/build-and-test-summary.md`:

```markdown
# Build And Test Summary: <unit>

## Commands
- `<command>`: <passed|failed|unavailable|skipped> — <why>

## Failures And Corrections
- <diagnostic summary> -> <fix applied> -> <rerun result>

## Coverage / Performance
- <available metrics or Not detected>

## Residual Risk
- <remaining risks, blockers, or manual verification>
```

## Rules

- Never report validation as passed unless the command actually ran and passed.
- Do not hide failing output. Summarize it and keep enough detail for reproduction.
- Human review begins after local backpressure is exhausted, not before.
