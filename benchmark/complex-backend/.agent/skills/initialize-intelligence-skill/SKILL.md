# Initialize GraphWard

Create a trustworthy, evidence-backed project intelligence baseline. Analyze only artifacts present in source code, configuration, tests, infrastructure, and existing documentation. Mark unknowns and uncertainties explicitly — never invent architecture, APIs, schemas, or business rules.

**Compute the derived-fact baseline first:** `npx gw claims derive .` extracts module imports, package dependencies and HTTP routes from source and records them as *derived* claims. Their statements are generated from the extracted descriptor, so `claims verify` can RE-COMPUTE them and genuinely prove whether each still holds — that is the only kind of claim allowed to be called a fact.

For durable statements the derivation cannot express, record an *asserted* claim: `npx gw claims add --statement "<fact>" --evidence "<path>:<start>-<end>" --author "<who>"`. Be clear about what this does and does not buy you: the evidence span is hash-pinned, so edits to the cited lines are detected, but nothing checks that your sentence is TRUE of that code. Asserted claims report `unverified` and `get_context` serves them under an explicit unverified heading. Never write an asserted claim to make something look confirmed.

## Inputs

- Repository root path (current working directory by default)
- Optional: explicit scope constraints (monorepo package, service boundary)

## Procedure

0. **Seed User Intelligence Profile (zero tokens)** — Before any discovery:

   ```bash
   npx gw user-profile .
   npx gw freshness .
   npx gw git-analysis .
   ```

   These three commands auto-populate:
   - Developer identity, language, test philosophy, and commit style → personal profile
   - Freshness scores for any pre-existing intelligence documents
   - Hotspots, ownership, and coupling for the repository

   Read the generated profile at `.graphward/memory/users/<slug>/user-intelligence.md` and apply Active Predictions for the rest of this session. Skip if CI environment is detected.

1. **Discover** — Scan for: package manifests, workspace configs, runtimes (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.), build systems, entrypoints, CI configs, Dockerfiles, deployment manifests, environment examples, database schemas/migrations, API definitions, auth configs, test suites.

2. **Trace Architecture** — Follow imports, dependency injection, middleware registration, route definitions, event handlers, and service boundaries. Map the critical runtime flows from code evidence, not assumptions.

3. **Write Knowledge Base** — For each document:
   - Open with a one-paragraph summary
   - Back every material claim with a file path reference: `(evidence: path/to/file:L42)`
   - Use `**Not detected**` for absent features, not silence
   - Use `**Unclear from evidence** — [reason]` for ambiguous areas
   - Use tables, code blocks, and structured lists — never prose walls

4. **Validate Claims** — Re-read each knowledge document, check major claims against actual files, and write `15-validation-report.md` with findings categorized as: ✅ Supported, ⚠️ Partially Supported, ❌ Unsupported, ❓ Needs Human Review.

5. **Generate Memory** — Extract only durable, long-lived decisions and patterns. Do NOT store transient implementation details. Each entry needs a `Source:` evidence reference.

6. **Generate Context** — Create concise, navigational maps. Each map should fit in ~100 lines. Optimize for an AI agent quickly finding the right file, not for human reading.

7. **Build Graphs** — Two sub-steps:
   a. Run `gw map .` (or `npx gw map .` if not globally installed) to generate the real computed `dependency-graph.json` from source code. The CLI output (node count, edge count, graph path) serves as evidence. This graph is fully validated against the schema.
   b. Invoke `graph-engine` to produce the remaining three JSON graphs (`service-graph.json`, `runtime-graph.json`, `business-flow-graph.json`) and `architecture-map.md`. Every node and edge must have `evidence` and `confidence` fields.

8. **Generate Events** — Write change-event guidance documents that describe what to check and update when specific types of changes occur.

9. **Write History** — Create `CHG-000-initialization.md` with: timestamp, artifacts generated, confidence summary, areas needing human confirmation.

10. **Report** — Summarize: total artifacts created, evidence coverage percentage estimate, high-confidence vs low-confidence areas, explicit list of items requiring human review.

## Cross-References

- Uses: `deep-project-knowledge-extractor`, `knowledge-base-validator`, `graph-engine`, `change-history-engine`
- Consumed by: `graphward-skill`, all sync engines, `impact-analysis-engine`

This initialization documents and validates the project. It does not implement product changes.
