/**
 * Derived facts — statements the tool can RE-COMPUTE, and therefore actually verify.
 *
 * The distinction this module exists to enforce:
 *
 *   An anchor proves a symbol still EXISTS. It does not prove the sentence bound
 *   to it is TRUE. A claim like "the auth endpoint is rate-limited", anchored to a
 *   handler with no rate limiting, resolves fine, hashes cleanly, and would report
 *   `verified` forever. That is an expensive mtime wearing a green checkmark, and
 *   it is worse than no claim at all because it is trusted.
 *
 * A *derived* fact is a structured descriptor plus a rendering function. Its
 * statement is not authored — it is generated from the descriptor. Verification
 * re-derives the whole fact set from source and asks whether this fact is still
 * in it. So "verified" means the sentence itself was recomputed and still holds.
 *
 * Anything a human or a model writes freehand is an *asserted* claim (see
 * index.ts) and can never earn that label.
