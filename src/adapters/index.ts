This repository uses installed GraphWard workflows.

- When a provider-installed custom-agent directory exists, start non-trivial work with the engineering-orchestrator custom agent. Never assume an agent path exists; use the active provider's installed manifest.
- For initial understanding and documentation, invoke \`initialize-graphward\` or ask the agent to initialize GraphWard.
- For implementation work, invoke \`graphward\` with the request or ask the agent to apply the GraphWard workflow. This workflow embeds AI-DLC and Agile delivery modes internally.
- For epic-sized initiatives, invoke \`decompose-backlog\` to autonomously create an Epic → Feature → Ticket backlog under \`.graphward/aidlc/agile/backlog/\`, then \`deliver-backlog\` to implement it feature by feature. Each feature requires human approval before implementation; the local backlog is the source of truth and can optionally be mirrored to GitHub Issues.
- For architecture mapping, impact analysis, synchronization, or review, invoke \`map-architecture\`, \`analyze-impact\`, \`sync-graphward\`, or \`review-engineering-change\`; these workflows do not modify product code.
- Canonical generated outputs live in \`.graphward/knowledge-base/\`, \`.graphward/aidlc/\`, \`.graphward/memory/\`, \`.graphward/context/\`, \`.graphward/events/\`, \`.graphward/graph/\`, \`.graphward/reports/\`, \`.graphward/flight/\`, and \`.graphward/changes/\`.
- Before non-trivial edits, write an impact report; after edits, validate and incrementally synchronize only affected intelligence and graph artifacts.
- AI-DLC work must preserve durable state in \`.graphward/aidlc/aidlc-state.md\`, maintain Agile artifacts, use environmental backpressure, and end with an \`AI-DLC: <phase> -> <stage> -> <status>\` breadcrumb.
- Base documentation claims on repository evidence and identify unknowns explicitly.
- **Prefer persisted intelligence over re-exploration.** Before reading source files to understand the codebase, read the persisted knowledge base in \`.graphward/knowledge-base/\`, context maps in \`.graphward/context/\`, and architecture graphs in \`.graphward/graph/\`. Re-read source only for the specific files a task touches. Run \`sync-graphward\` to refresh these artifacts incrementally rather than re-deriving from scratch each session.
- **Route before loading skills.** Consult the active provider's installed \`WORKFLOW-ROUTING.md\` and \`SKILLS-INDEX.md\` before opening an internal \`SKILL.md\`. Entry workflows are model-invocable; internal engines are loaded only through the selected route.

## Tools (prefer these over reasoning by hand)

These run deterministically. Use them instead of inferring the answer from source — they are the difference between a computed fact and a guess. Available over MCP (server \`graphward\`) and as CLI commands:

${MCP_TOOL_SUMMARY.map(([n, d]) => `- \`${n}\` — ${d}`).join("\n")}

CLI equivalents: \`npx gw map|gate <name>|verify|freshness|context|claims verify|git-analysis .\`. \`gate\` and \`verify\` exit non-zero on failure, so they work in CI too.

## Token-Efficient Skill Loading (Claude Code)

**Three-tier loading protocol** — follow this order on every invocation:

**Tier 1 — Routing (load once, always pinned)**
1. \`.claude/WORKFLOW-ROUTING.md\` — primary/optional skill map per command (~400t)
2. \`.claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md\` — one-line description of all ${SKILL_NAMES.length} skills (~1,500t)

**Tier 2 — Brief (load per identified skill, ~150t each)**
Load \`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL-BRIEF.md\` for each primary skill identified in the routing table.
The brief confirms relevance and summarises inputs — do not execute the skill from the brief alone.

**Tier 3 — Full skill (load at execution time only)**
Load \`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` immediately before executing that skill's procedure.
Never skip this step — the brief does not contain the complete procedure.

Load **optional** skills only when the request explicitly requires that capability.

## Enforcement Hooks (Claude Code)

\`.claude/settings.json\` wires four lifecycle hooks to \`gw hook <event>\`:
- **SessionStart** injects the current intelligence freshness/drift summary.
- **PreToolUse** warns before editing source while documentation is stale.
- **PostToolUse** records changed source files and validation commands for the session.
- **Stop** can require that a validation command actually ran before finishing.

Tune behaviour in \`.graphward/gw.config.json\` (\`hooks.blockStaleEdits\`, \`hooks.requireValidationOnStop\`, \`hooks.freshnessThreshold\`). Hooks are fail-safe: with no intelligence installed they do nothing.
