/**
 * How a rendered artifact is owned on disk.
 *
 * file       — we own the whole file; local edits conflict on update.
 * block      — we own a marked region of a Markdown file.
 * seed       — we write it once if absent, then never touch it again. For files
 *              the USER is expected to edit (gw.config.json is how enforcement is
 *              turned on), so editing it must not raise a doctor warning or block
 *              the next update.
 * json-merge — we own only specific keys inside a JSON file the user also owns
 *              (their .claude/settings.json holds permissions, model, env). Ours
 *              are merged in and removed on uninstall; theirs are never touched.
