# Launch posts

Ready-to-paste copy for launching `graphward`. This file is **not**
published to npm (the package only ships `dist`, `templates`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`).

The through-line for every post: **your codebase's AI memory shouldn't be trapped in one
tool** — and the proof is a *computed* dependency + call graph and an MCP server, not
LLM-written prose. Lead with portability + the computed core. Do **not** lead with token
savings.

## 1. Hacker News — "Show HN"

**Title:**
> Show HN: GraphWard – a portable, computed codebase graph for AI IDEs

**Body:**

I kept switching between AI coding tools — Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot — and every switch
meant re-explaining my codebase from scratch. Each tool keeps its understanding locked
inside itself, and most "AI project memory" is just markdown an LLM wrote and hopes to
re-read later.

So I built graphward around a different idea: codebase intelligence should
be a **repo artifact** (like tests or docs), computed by real code, and queryable by any
AI tool.

Two parts are actual deterministic code, not prompts:

- `gw map .` builds a dependency + **function-level call graph**
  (package/import edges across JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Java/Kotlin; symbol-level
  `defines`/`calls` edges for JS/TS). Every node/edge has `evidence` (file:line) and a
  `confidence` level, validated against a fixed JSON schema. No LLM involved.
- An **MCP server** exposes `map_dependencies`, `get_graph`, `analyze_impact`, and
  `read_knowledge` as tool calls, so any MCP-compatible agent can ask "what calls this
  function?" or "what breaks if I change this file?" and get a computed answer.

On top of that there's a portability layer: one canonical set of skills/agents/workflows
that renders natively into 9 IDEs, so the same intelligence works whether you're in Claude
Code today and Cursor tomorrow.

Honest about the current state: the graph engine and MCP server are real and tested; the
call graph is heuristic (regex-based, JS/TS only so far) rather than full AST, and the
skills layer is structured instructions whose effectiveness depends on your IDE's model.
I'd love feedback on the graph/impact model specifically.

## 3. X / Twitter thread

**1/**
Your codebase's AI memory shouldn't be trapped in one tool.

I built an open-source intelligence layer that lives in your repo and works across 9 AI
IDEs — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini & more.

The core isn't a prompt. It's a computed graph. 🧵

**2/**
`gw map .`

→ a real dependency + **function-level call graph**
→ JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Java/Kotlin
→ every edge cites evidence (file:line) + confidence
→ schema-validated, deterministic, no LLM

**3/**
"What breaks if I change this?"

Change a file → instantly see which functions and modules call into it. Computed by
reverse-BFS over the call graph, not guessed by a model.

**4/**
There's a built-in MCP server too. 🔌

4 tools any agent can call: map_dependencies, get_graph, analyze_impact, read_knowledge.

Your repo's structure becomes a queryable service — no markdown to install into the IDE.

**5/**
Why it matters: developers switch AI tools constantly now. The understanding shouldn't
reset every time. Make it a repo artifact — like tests or docs.

**6/**
Open source, MIT. One command:

`npx gw`

https://github.com/vinideep/graphward

Honest note: call graph is heuristic/JS-TS for now, full AST + more languages next.
Feedback very welcome 🙏 (cc @AnthropicAI @cursor_ai)

## Posting order (suggested)

1. **HN Show HN** first (weekday morning US time) — highest-signal audience, no karma gate.
2. **r/ClaudeAI megathread** comment same day (works around the 50-karma post rule).
3. **LinkedIn** + **X thread** to amplify, linking the repo (and the HN thread if it gets
   traction).
