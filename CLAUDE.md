# GraphWard OS

This repository uses installed engineering intelligence workflows.

- When the .agents/agents/ directory is available, start non-trivial work with the engineering-orchestrator custom agent. It routes the request to the right specialist and keeps the workflow evidence-based.
- For initial understanding and documentation, invoke `initialize-graphward` or ask the agent to initialize engineering intelligence.
- For implementation work, invoke `graphward` with the request or ask the agent to apply the engineering intelligence workflow. This workflow embeds AI-DLC and Agile delivery modes internally.
- For epic-sized initiatives, invoke `decompose-backlog` to autonomously create an Epic → Feature → Ticket backlog under `.graphward/aidlc/agile/backlog/`, then `deliver-backlog` to implement it feature by feature. Each feature requires human approval before implementation; the local backlog is the source of truth and can optionally be mirrored to GitHub Issues.
- For architecture mapping, impact analysis, synchronization, or review, invoke `map-architecture`, `analyze-impact`, `sync-graphward`, or `review-engineering-change`; these workflows do not modify product code.
- Canonical generated outputs live in `.graphward/knowledge-base/`, `.graphward/aidlc/`, `.graphward/memory/`, `.graphward/context/`, `.graphward/events/`, `.graphward/graph/`, `.graphward/reports/`, `.graphward/flight/`, and `.graphward/changes/`.
- Before non-trivial edits, write an impact report; after edits, validate and incrementally synchronize only affected intelligence and graph artifacts.
- AI-DLC work must preserve durable state in `.graphward/aidlc/aidlc-state.md`, maintain Agile artifacts, use environmental backpressure, and end with an `AI-DLC: <phase> -> <stage> -> <status>` breadcrumb.
- Base documentation claims on repository evidence and identify unknowns explicitly.
- **Prefer persisted intelligence over re-exploration.** Before reading source files to understand the codebase, read the persisted knowledge base in `.graphward/knowledge-base/`, context maps in `.graphward/context/`, and architecture graphs in `.graphward/graph/`. Re-read source only for the specific files a task touches. Run `sync-graphward` to refresh these artifacts incrementally rather than re-deriving from scratch each session.
- **Route before loading skills.** Consult the installed `WORKFLOW-ROUTING.md` and `SKILLS-INDEX.md` in your IDE's skills directory before opening any individual `SKILL.md`. Load only the 1-3 skills relevant to the current request.

## Tools (prefer these over reasoning by hand)

These run deterministically. Use them instead of inferring the answer from source — they are the difference between a computed fact and a guess. Available over MCP (server `graphward`) and as CLI commands:

- `get_engineering_context` — build ContextPackV2 from verified GraphWard knowledge, canonical structure, and current scoped code
- `analyze_change_impact` — compute direct and indirect impact, affected tests, risks, and unknowns
- `validate_change` — run impact, safety gates, claims, knowledge, and citation validation
- `sync_engineering_knowledge` — refresh affected graph, provider indexes, claims, and knowledge health after edits
- `provider_status` — report pinned provider health, versions, fallbacks, and remediation

CLI equivalents: `npx gw map|gate <name>|verify|freshness|context|claims verify|git-analysis .`. `gate` and `verify` exit non-zero on failure, so they work in CI too.

## Token-Efficient Skill Loading (Claude Code)

**Three-tier loading protocol** — follow this order on every invocation:

**Tier 1 — Routing (load once, always pinned)**
1. `.claude/WORKFLOW-ROUTING.md` — primary/optional skill map per command (~400t)
2. `.claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md` — one-line description of all 46 skills (~1,500t)

**Tier 2 — Brief (load per identified skill, ~150t each)**
Load `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL-BRIEF.md` for each primary skill identified in the routing table.
The brief confirms relevance and summarises inputs — do not execute the skill from the brief alone.

**Tier 3 — Full skill (load at execution time only)**
Load `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` immediately before executing that skill's procedure.
Never skip this step — the brief does not contain the complete procedure.

Load **optional** skills only when the request explicitly requires that capability.

## Enforcement Hooks (Claude Code)

`.claude/settings.json` wires four lifecycle hooks to `gw hook <event>`:
- **SessionStart** injects the current intelligence freshness/drift summary.
- **PreToolUse** warns before editing source while documentation is stale.
- **PostToolUse** records changed source files and validation commands for the session.
- **Stop** can require that a validation command actually ran before finishing.

Tune behaviour in `.graphward/gw.config.json` (`blockStaleEdits`, `requireValidationOnStop`, `freshnessThreshold`). Hooks are fail-safe: with no intelligence installed they do nothing.
