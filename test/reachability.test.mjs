/**
 * Reachability and tool-backing tests.
 *
 * Two failure modes this pins:
 *
 *  1. A skill that ships but is named by no workflow route and no agent is dead
 *     weight — it costs install size and index tokens while the retrieval path
 *     the toolkit tells the model to obey can never surface it.
 *
 *  2. A skill whose work is already done deterministically by a CLI/MCP command,
 *     but which does not SAY SO in its opening lines, invites the model to
 *     re-derive the answer by hand. That is precisely what small models do worst.
 *     Tool-backing — not skill count — is the property that makes them reliable.
