/**
 * The derived/asserted split.
 *
 * The failure this prevents: an anchor proves a symbol still EXISTS; it does not
 * prove the sentence bound to it is TRUE. A claim like "the auth endpoint is
 * rate-limited", anchored to a handler with no rate limiting, resolves fine,
 * hashes cleanly, and under the old model reported `verified` forever — an
 * expensive mtime wearing a green checkmark, and worse than no claim because it
 * is trusted.
 *
 * Derived claims are RENDERED from a machine-extracted descriptor, so verifying
 * them re-computes the sentence. Asserted claims are free text and can never
 * earn the word "verified".
